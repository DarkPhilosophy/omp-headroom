**omp-headroom** integrates the [Headroom](https://github.com/chopratejas/headroom) context-optimization proxy into [OMP (Oh My Pi)](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi) coding sessions. Eligible provider payloads pass through a local compression layer only when Headroom proves a strict token reduction and the extension has persisted the original for retrieval.

> **Planned first release: `0.1.0-beta.1`** — this repository has not yet published an npm package, Git tag, or GitHub release. npm will distribute the OMP plugin; GitHub is the canonical release and documentation source.

## How it works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    OMP[OMP session] -->|before_provider_request| PLUGIN[omp-headroom plugin]
    PLUGIN -->|/v1/compress| PROXY["Headroom proxy<br/>127.0.0.1:8787"]
    PROXY -->|compressed payload| PLUGIN
    PLUGIN --> LLM[LLM provider]
    LLM -->|headroom_retrieve hash| PLUGIN
    PLUGIN -->|durable CCR fallback| CCR[Local archive store]
```

- **Provider-path compression** — eligible OpenAI `messages`, Anthropic, and OpenAI Responses (`input`) payloads are compressed before they reach the provider. Oversized tool outputs compress concurrently in a bounded worker pool.
- **Automatic provider archive** — before proxy compression, a sufficiently large stable conversation prefix is replaced only on the outbound request by a shorter structural index. The complete prefix is persisted to CCR first, while the newest 24 messages remain verbatim. This is the original source of widget `arch`; it is independent of OMP compaction.
- **Strict reduction gate** — a candidate is accepted only when Headroom reports `tokens_after < tokens_before`, the actual outgoing payload is smaller, every user message is unchanged, and a local CCR fallback was persisted. Otherwise OMP sends the original payload unchanged and does not inject the retrieval tool.
- **CCR retrieval** — accepted content carries a `Retrieve more: hash=…` marker; the model calls `headroom_retrieve` to read the original. The proxy store is backed by an atomic on-disk fallback.
- **Headroom-assisted OMP compaction (`/headroom compact`)** — unlike OMP's plain `/compact`, this command arms a one-shot `session.compacting` hook that atomically archives the complete discarded source to CCR and adds fidelity guidance before OMP creates its semantic LLM summary. If archival fails, OMP still compacts but the plugin does not claim a recoverable archive.
- **Adaptive thresholds** — as the context window fills (>50%), the "worth compressing" bar drops linearly, down to 25% of the base at 90% usage. More compression exactly when space is scarce.
- **Autoupdate** — the extension checks PyPI daily, upgrades `headroom-ai` in place, re-pins the ROCm torch build when needed, and restarts the proxy.
- **Live widget** — savings, request/tool/CCR counters, archive state, and per-session cost, rendered in a compact 4-row box.

## Install

### After beta publication

```bash
omp plugin install omp-headroom@beta
omp plugin doctor
```

Start OMP once to provision the local `headroom-ai` virtual environment and proxy. For a persistent proxy shared by OMP sessions:

```text
/headroom service install
```

The service command writes only `~/.config/systemd/user/headroom-proxy.service`; it refuses to replace a unit whose contents differ from this release. Inspect or remove the unit yourself before rerunning the command, and remove the managed service explicitly with:

```text
/headroom service uninstall
```

### Checkout / development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DarkPhilosophy/omp-headroom.git
cd omp-headroom
bun install
omp plugin link .
omp plugin doctor
```

`omp plugin link .` registers the checkout and loads `src/index.ts`; no file is copied into `~/.omp/agent/extensions`.

The OMP plugin owns the complete lifecycle:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    INSTALL[omp plugin install/link] --> OMP[OMP plugin registry]
    OMP --> START[First OMP session]
    START --> VENV[Provision or update headroom-ai venv]
    VENV --> GPU[Preserve CUDA / re-pin ROCm when needed]
    START --> PROXY[Start or connect to loopback proxy]
    OMP --> CMD[/headroom service install/]
    CMD --> UNIT[Optional systemd --user service]
```

There is intentionally no second installer script. Keeping provisioning in the plugin prevents an `install.sh` path from drifting away from `omp plugin install`, `/headroom update`, and `/headroom service`.

Provisioning prefers `uv` when available and otherwise falls back to `python3 -m venv` plus that environment's `pip`; a global `uv` install is not required. Override the fallback interpreter with `OMP_HEADROOM_PYTHON` or the preferred `uv` executable with `OMP_HEADROOM_UV`.

## Commands

Type `/headroom ` in OMP to open argument completion. Commands are intercepted before submission, so they do not appear in the chat transcript or consume provider context.

## Widget

The unified `arch Nch ×M` metric describes automatic provider-prefix archiving in both volume and count:

```text
╭─ Headroom ────────────────────────────── session ─╮
│ saved 192.1k · proxy 6.6% · arch 3.3Mch ×3       │
│ req 99 · tool 2 · ccr 5 · com 3                  │
╰─ $1.23 · $45.67 ──────────────── ctx $8.90 ──────╯
```

In this example, `arch 3.3Mch ×3` means that **three automatic provider archives** succeeded and removed **3.3 million characters in total** from outbound context. The first row reports savings, including archive volume and count; the second reports operation counts for requests, tool compression, CCR artifacts, and OMP compaction.

| Display | Meaning | When it changes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `saved N` | Proxy tokens saved in the current OMP session. | After Headroom accepts a strictly smaller provider payload. |
| `proxy N%` | Percentage of attempted proxy input tokens saved. The `proxy` label appears when archive savings share the row; otherwise only `N%` is shown. | Recomputed from the proxy's per-session statistics. |
| `arch Nch ×M` | Cumulative characters removed (`Nch`) and successful automatic provider-prefix archives (`M`) in this session. | Both values increase only after the complete removed prefix is durably stored in CCR and the outbound archive projection is smaller. |
| `req N` | Provider requests recorded for this session. | Increases when a provider request is observed by Headroom's proxy statistics. |
| `tool N` | Oversized tool results successfully compressed. | Increases only after a strictly smaller tool result with a retrievable original is accepted. |
| `ccr N` | New retrievable CCR artifacts created by this process/session. | Increases after a previously unseen original is persisted successfully. |
| `com N` | Count of completed OMP session compactions, including `/compact` and `/headroom compact`. | Increases on OMP's completed `session_compact` event; it never changes `arch`. |
| `(+N)` | Additional activity produced by subagent sessions. | Appears beside `req`, `tool`, or `ccr` when the foreign count is non-zero. |
| `ch` | Characters, not tokens. | Unit suffix for provider-archive source reduction. |
| `k`, `M`, `B` | Decimal abbreviations: thousand, million, billion. | Values are rounded to one decimal place. |
| bottom `$A · $B` | Current-session proxy savings, then lifetime proxy savings. | Loaded from proxy cost statistics. |
| `ctx $N` | Current session's accumulated provider input cost. | Appears only when the value is greater than zero. |

The rainbow, clickable `Headroom` title means the proxy is ready. A gray title shows `off`, `starting…`, installation activity, `offline`, or a truncated error. The top-right value is the first eight characters of the OMP session ID.

Zero-value `arch` and `com` metrics are hidden. Archive totals are persisted per full OMP session ID and hydrated before the first widget render, so the unified `arch Nch ×M` metric survives process restarts and `omp --resume`. `/headroom version` prints the loaded source path and a 12-character SHA-256 build fingerprint for diagnosing stale or duplicate plugin loads.

CCR originals are stored under a validated full OMP session ID (`headroom-ccr/<sessionId>/<hash>.txt`) and are **not expired by wall-clock age**, because a resumable session may still reference them. Cleanup is explicit: `/headroom clear session` only displays the confirmation guard, while `/headroom clear session confirm` removes the current session's owned CCR files and persisted `arch` counters. It does not clear proxy request/lifetime statistics, other sessions, or legacy root-level CCR files whose ownership cannot be proven.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant O as OMP
    participant H as Headroom plugin
    participant C as CCR store
    participant L as LLM provider
    O->>H: before_provider_request(messages)
    H->>H: select stable prefix, preserve live tail
    H->>C: persist complete prefix atomically
    C-->>H: retrievable hash
    H->>L: smaller archive index + verbatim live tail
    O-->>H: session_compact (separate path)
    H->>H: increment com only
```

Automatic compression and provider archiving never rewrite visible transcript messages. They alter only a strictly smaller outbound provider payload after its removed bytes are durably retrievable. `headroom_compress` remains an explicit manual operation and therefore returns its compact result visibly.

> **Widget placement caveat:** this extension asks for the `rightEditor` widget slot, which currently exists only in a right-panel OMP fork that has not been merged upstream. On stock OMP the widget renders at the **bottom** of the screen (the default slot) — functional, just a different position. Override with `OMP_HEADROOM_WIDGET_PLACEMENT`.

## Configuration

Configuration can live in `~/.omp/agent/headroom.yml` or in `OMP_HEADROOM_*` environment variables. Environment variables always win; unknown YAML keys are ignored, and a malformed or absent YAML file falls back to environment/default values.

## Fidelity model

Three rules, in this order:

1. **Never accept proxy token growth** — missing, equal, increasing, fractional, or contradictory Headroom token metrics are rejected even if character count falls.
2. **Archive only a smaller outbound projection** — provider-prefix archival runs only when the complete projected message array is smaller than the original.
3. **Keep the live conversation verbatim** — proxy compression cannot mutate user messages, and provider archiving preserves the configured recent live tail by identity.
4. **Never lose removed bytes** — every proxy compression and automatic prefix archive persists its complete original under a CCR hash before changing the provider payload. Persistence failure means pass-through.
